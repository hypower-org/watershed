Watershed

<<<<<<< HEAD
A library for defining and connecting streams.

![alt tag](http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DEP/Resources/Images/water/Outreach/What_is_a_Watershed_rockingham-nc.gif) 

The purpose of this library is to allow the definition and connection of streams of information in a graph-like structure called a Watershed.  A watershed is composed of-ideally-many waterways.  

A waterway is defined by a name, its tributaries, and a sieve.  The name is simply an identifier; tributaries are the source waterways that feed into the sink waterway; and the sieve defines how the information "flows" from the tributaries to the output.

More detail to come soon!

This work was funded by the National Science Foundation through grant CNS-1239221.
