Watershed
=========

A library for defining and connecting streams.  

The purpose of this library is to allow the definition and connection of streams of information in a graph-like structure called a Watershed.  A watershed is composed of - ideally - many rivers.  

A river is defined by a name, its tributaries, and a sieve.  The name is simply and identifier; tributaries are the source rivers that feed into the sink river; and the sieve defines how the information "flows" from the tributaries to the output.
